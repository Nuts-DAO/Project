# Project
## Welcome to your starting point in the NutsDAO Developer Champions Program! 🌰🙌

This program is designed to **empower developers in the JuChain ecosystem**, unlock your creative potential, and support you in bringing wild ideas to life on-chain. As a Champion, you'll gain access to dedicated resources to **level up your skills**, participate in DAO initiatives, and co-build the future of Web3 with some of the most unconventional and driven builders in the space.

You'll also find opportunities to:

- 🎯 Network with other NutsDAO developers and builders  
- 🧠 Learn from Kernel Council members and senior contributors  
- 🎁 Earn exclusive merch and NFT badges based on your level and contributions  
- 🚀 Showcase your projects to the DAO and broader ecosystem  
- 🧑‍🏫 Help onboard and mentor new contributors into our crazy builder's utopia  

To begin your journey as a **Nuts Starter**, simply submit a new application in this repository and share your motivation to build on JuChain.
